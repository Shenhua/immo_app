Yes — there are a few macro-level logic mismatches that can absolutely produce “weird / too small” result sets and can make the “best results” unreliable, even if the underlying math is OK.

Below is a full end-to-end logic audit (UI → configs → generation → allocation → simulation → accept/filter → scoring/sorting), focused on objective flaws (must-fix) vs subjective improvements (nice-to-have).

⸻

1) End-to-end pipeline (what actually happens)

A) UI collects params → builds eval/config dicts
	•	app.py collects sidebar parameters and builds fin_config, op_config, and eval_params, then calls run_strategy_search(...).  ￼
	•	Important: the returned sidebar payload does not include a “how many results to keep/show” parameter (no top_n / result_count), so the engine can silently default to small lists.  ￼

B) Financing config is partially hardcoded in controller
	•	In build_financing_config, durations + rates are hardcoded (15/20/25 years with fixed thresholds), rather than being fed from UX as first-class inputs.  ￼
This is exactly the class of discrepancy you mentioned (UX says one thing, engine uses another).

C) Strategy generation → allocation → simulation → scoring
	•	Strategies are simulated and then cashflow acceptability + scoring decide what survives and how “best” is defined.
	•	You already have a canonical business-rules module (glossary.py) intended as “single source of truth”.  ￼

⸻

2) 🔴 OBJECTIVE FLAWS (Must Fix)

2.1 “Min cashflow” mode is implemented like “target proximity” (wrong acceptance logic)

Your UI explicitly distinguishes:
	•	Precise target (“viser une cible”) vs
	•	Minimum cashflow (“cash-flow minimum, peut être supérieur”)  ￼

But the acceptance logic in calculate_cashflow_metrics() is:

gap_y1 = abs(cf_y1_monthly - target_cf)
is_acceptable = gap_y1 <= tolerance

Meaning: if the target is 0 and the strategy produces +300€/mo, it can be rejected because abs(300 - 0) > tolerance.
That contradicts the “minimum” semantics.  ￼

✅ Impact: drastically reduces results, and produces “small weird result sets” that don’t reflect reality (especially in “min” mode).
✅ Fix direction (no code yet):
	•	For min mode: treat “gap” as max(0, target_cf - cf) (one-sided), and accept if cf >= target_cf - tolerance (no penalty for being above).
	•	For target mode: keep absolute proximity.

2.2 Scoring also assumes “proximity to target” (same semantic bug)

Your StrategyScorer uses:
	•	cashflow_proximity = -abs(cf_target - cf_moyen) / max(1, tolerance)  ￼

So even if acceptance were fixed, the ranking would still penalize “too good” cashflow in min-mode, and could reorder “best” strategies incorrectly.

✅ Impact: allocator/sorter can be “correct” but still pick bad winners because the objective function is wrong.
✅ Fix direction: scoring must be mode-aware (min vs target).

2.3 Hardcoded financing thresholds can invalidate “best results” under UX assumptions

Even if your allocator/simulator are correct, the search space is being built on controller-level assumptions:
	•	durations fixed to [15, 20, 25]
	•	rates fixed to specific thresholds
￼

If UX lets users change durations/rates (or if they think they are), then the engine is optimizing the wrong world.

✅ Impact: “best results” are best only for the hardcoded financing regime, not the UX regime.

2.4 Result count control missing at the pipeline boundary (forces silent truncation)

From app.py, there’s no top_n/result_count passed into run_strategy_search.  ￼
So the service layer will default to whatever internal limit it has, and users can observe a mysteriously small set.

✅ Impact: exactly matches “we end up with a weird and small number of results”.

⸻

3) 🟡 High-risk design choices (can become “macro bugs” depending on intent)

3.1 MAX_EXTRA_APPORT_PCT is an env cap (not visible in UX)

You cap extra apport per property through an env var:  ￼
This can heavily affect feasibility (cashflow) and therefore result counts, but it’s “invisible” to users unless surfaced.

3.2 “Use full capital” conflicts with “precise target” behavior

Your UX says some modes want to deploy more capital, others want precision.  ￼
If allocator logic short-circuits once the cashflow is “good enough”, you can end up with lots of leftover apport even when the user expects full deployment. (I can’t cite the allocator branch here because the allocator body wasn’t fully visible in the excerpts I retrieved, but your debug logs strongly suggest “success with remaining_apport”.)

⸻

4) What I would audit next (and what I need access confirmation for)

To complete the “whole process” audit down to allocator rules and “wrong sorting” claims, I need full visibility into:
	•	src/services/allocator.py (full function bodies; current excerpts truncate mid-file)
	•	src/services/strategy_finder.py (full filtering & truncation decisions)
	•	src/services/optimizer.py (whether there’s a hard MAX_TOTAL or early-stop that clips the search)

If those are present in your gitingest TXT, I can trace them — but the snippets returned to me cut off before the decisive parts. If you want, re-send the gitingest export with those three files untruncated (or paste them directly), and I’ll produce a “single-thread narrative trace” showing exactly where/why candidates get discarded.

⸻

5) Practical roadmap (logic-first, no new features)

Phase A — Make intent executable (stop “goal drift”)
	1.	Define mode_cf contract:
	•	target: minimize absolute distance to target
	•	min: maximize cashflow subject to cf >= target - tol (one-sided)
	2.	Apply that contract consistently in:
	•	acceptance (calculate_cashflow_metrics)  ￼
	•	scoring (cashflow_proximity)  ￼

Phase B — Remove hidden constraints
	3.	Surface or log all “silent caps” that change feasibility:
	•	env MAX_EXTRA_APPORT_PCT  ￼
	4.	Make financing inputs authoritative:
	•	move durations/rates out of hardcode and into UX → config  ￼

Phase C — Stop unexplained truncation
	5.	Add an explicit top_n (result_count) from UI to run_strategy_search boundary (currently absent).  ￼
	6.	Log: generated_combos, evaluated, accepted_cf, allocation_ok, final_kept, with reasons for rejection.

⸻

If you paste (or re-export) the full allocator.py, strategy_finder.py, and optimizer.py, I’ll do the next pass as a strict “pipeline trace” and I’ll point to the exact lines where:
	•	candidates are clipped,
	•	sorting/ranking is inconsistent with the stated goal,
	•	and hardcoded values override UX.
